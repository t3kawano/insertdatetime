# insertdatetime
written on python 3.11 spyder
run and choose a folder to insert create time and modifed time to the top of the .md files.
This script doesnt work subfolder recursively.
so run the script multiple times if you need to modify files within several folders...

also it force to insert srtings to the top of file without concidering whether the file already have yaml.

you may need another way to marge or substitute such old yaml front matter.
