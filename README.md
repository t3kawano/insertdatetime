# insertdatetime

This Python 3.11 script, launched through Spyder, helps you easily add creation and modification times as YAML front matter to markdown files within a chosen folder. While it functions within the selected directory, it currently lacks the ability to process subfolders recursively. 
To address files in nested folders, simply run the script on each relevant directory. 
Please note that the script currently insert new YAML front matter without concidering whether already a YAML front matter exit or not in markdown files. 
To handle existing configurations gracefully, consider implementing merging or substitution functionalities for future versions or use other methods.
